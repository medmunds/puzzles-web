# Differences in this version

This web adaptation of Simon Tatham’s Portable Puzzle Collection includes
some features and UI changes that are not included in the original.

::experimental:: Items with this symbol are considered experimental. Although
functional, they're likely to change significantly in future updates.
(There's also a slight possibility they might be removed entirely.)

## Changes affecting all puzzles

* ::experimental:: This version allows you to save and return to arbitrary
  [checkpoints](features#checkpoints) within the undo history.

* This version is built with "stylus mode" enabled. In many puzzles where
  left-clicking does one thing and right-clicking does another, you can instead
  repeatedly tap (or left-click) to cycle through all available states.

* The command line options described in the manual are not available on the web. 
  However, you can provide game parameters or an ID or random seed in the
  URL to particular puzzle: add *?type=params* or *?id=id-or-seed*. (From within 
  a game, look in the <command-link command="share:link">share dialog</command-link>
  for copyable links.) 

## Changes to specific puzzles

(All changes to individual puzzles have been accepted back into the original 
collection.)
