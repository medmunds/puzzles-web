# Installing

This web adaptation of the portable puzzle collection can be installed 
for offline use, so you don't need to have an internet connection to play. 

The exact steps to install the app can vary: look for your web browser below. 
And if the app doesn't open automatically after installing, be sure to launch 
it at least once while you're still online so it can download everything needed. 

(The installed app still runs in your web browser under the hood. It doesn't
have access to your files or anything else on your device. For technical details
of how this is possible, see Mozilla's [*What is a progressive web app?*][pwa-guide].)

## Android (Chrome) {#android}

Tap the ::ellipsis-vertical|three-dots:: menu near the address bar and choose
*::install-desktop:: Add to Home screen*.

(Or click the "Install app" banner that appears briefly when you first arrive 
at this website.)

Other Android web browsers often have similar steps, but if you get stuck see
the tips for [other browsers](#other) below.

## iOS (Safari) {#ios}

Tap the ::ios-share:: share icon next to the address bar, scroll down through
the sharing options and choose *Add to Home Screen ::square-plus::.*

The same steps often work in other iOS web browsers, but if not try installing
from Safari.

## Chrome desktop {#chrome-desktop}

Click the *::install-desktop:: Install app* icon that appears in the address bar.

## Firefox desktop (Windows) {#firefox-desktop}

On Windows, click the *::firefox-web-apps:: Add tab to taskbar* (web apps) icon 
that appears in the address bar.

On other platforms, Firefox does not yet support web apps. You can enable 
[offline use](#offline-in-browser) without installing, or if you have Chrome 
or Safari use one of them to install the puzzles as an app.

## Microsoft Edge (Windows) {#edge-desktop}

Click the *::edge-app-available:: App available* icon that appears in the address bar.

(Or click the ::ellipsis|three-dots:: menu at the top right, choose
*More tools,* then *Apps,* and then *Install.*)

## Safari desktop (macOS) {#safari-desktop}

Click the ::ios-share:: share icon next to the address bar and choose
*Add to Dock.*

## Installing from other browsers {#other}

If your browser isn't listed above, look for a command called something like 
“add to home screen” or “install app.” 

It might help to search the web for the browser or device name and "install 
PWA." For example, a web search for "Samsung Internet install PWA" will find 
instructions for installing from a Samsung mobile device's built-in web browser.

(PWA stands for progressive web app, the technical term for how this app is 
distributed.)

## Using offline without installing {#offline-in-browser}

Installing the puzzles as an app is preferred. But if your browser doesn't 
support web apps, you can still use the puzzles offline. In the puzzles'
<command-link command="settings:advanced">preferences</command-link>,
enable *Allow offline use* in the *Advanced* section.

This approach doesn't give you an app icon. To get to the puzzles offline, open 
your browser (dismiss any complaints about no internet connection) and navigate 
to the puzzles page. It's helpful to create a bookmark (favorite site) for the
puzzles while you're still online.
