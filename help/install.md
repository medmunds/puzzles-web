# Installing

This web adaptation of the portable puzzle collection can be installed 
for offline use, so you don't need to have an internet connection to play. 
The exact steps vary by web browser and platform.

## Android (Chrome) {#android}

Tap the ::ellipsis-vertical|three-dots:: menu near the address bar and choose
*::install-desktop:: Add to Home screen*.

(Or click the "Install app" banner that appears briefly when you first arrive 
at this website.)

Other Android web browsers often have similar steps, but if you get stuck see
[*Other browsers*](#other) below.

## iOS (Safari) {#ios}

Tap the ::ios-share:: share icon next to the address bar, scroll down through
the sharing options and choose *Add to Home Screen ::square-plus::.*

The same steps often work in other iOS web browsers, but if not try installing
from Safari.

## Chrome desktop {#chrome-desktop}

Click the *::install-desktop:: Install app* icon that appears in the address bar.

## Firefox desktop (Windows) {#firefox-desktop}

On Windows, click the *::firefox-web-apps:: Add tab to taskbar* (web apps) icon 
that appears in the address bar.

On other platforms, Firefox does not yet support web apps. You can enable 
[offline use](#offline-in-browser) without installing, or if you have Chrome 
or Safari use one of them to install the puzzles as an app.

## Microsoft Edge (Windows) {#edge-desktop}

Click the *::edge-app-available:: App available* icon that appears in the address bar.

(Or click the ::ellipsis|three-dots:: menu at the top right, choose
*More tools,* then *Apps,* and then *Install.*)

## Safari desktop (macOS) {#safari-desktop}

Click the ::ios-share:: share icon next to the address bar and choose
*Add to Dock.*

## Other browsers {#other}

Look for a command in your browser called something like “add to home screen” 
or “install app.” 

It might help to search the web for the browser or device name and "install PWA." 
For example, searching "Samsung Internet install PWA" will find instructions 
for installing from a Samsung mobile device's standard web browser.

(PWA stands for progressive web app, the technical term for how this app is 
distributed.)

## Offline in the browser {#offline-in-browser}

Installing the puzzles as an app is preferred, but if your browser doesn't
support that you may be able to enable offline use directly in the browser.
In the puzzles'
<command-link command="settings:advanced">preferences</command-link>,
select "Allow offline use" in the *Advanced* section. 

Be sure to bookmark the puzzles home page (or your favorite puzzle) so you 
can get to it when you don't have an internet connection.
